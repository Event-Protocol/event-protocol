# Welcome to The Event Protocol

**The Event Protocol** is a groundbreaking initiative focused on bridging the gap between blockchain events and real-world actions. We are building a modular, developer-friendly platform that enables seamless integration between blockchain technology and IoT devices, APIs, and AI-driven systems.

---

## üåü Vision

Our mission is to revolutionize how blockchain interacts with the physical world by creating a robust and flexible protocol that empowers developers, drives innovation, and opens up new possibilities in automation, supply chain management, gaming, environmental monitoring, and beyond.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Event Triggers:** Real-time monitoring of on-chain events like token transfers, governance decisions, and custom smart contract events.
- **Modular Actions:** Support for triggering IoT device actions, API calls, and AI-driven processes.
- **Multi-Chain Compatibility:** Seamless integration with Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible chains.
- **Developer Tools:** Intuitive YAML/JSON workflow definitions, SDKs, and comprehensive documentation.
- **Scalable and Secure Architecture:** Designed to handle real-world applications with robust security measures and low-latency processing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- `pip` package manager
- For Raspberry Pi integrations: GPIO libraries (use mock factory for non-Raspberry Pi environments).

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/event-protocol.git
cd event-protocol
```

### 3. Set Up the Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv eventp
source eventp/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```plaintext
INFURA_URL=<your_infura_url>
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<your_etherscan_api_key>
```

### 6. Define Intents and Modules

#### Example `intents.yaml`

```yaml
intents:
  - name: TestRaspberryPico
    trigger:
      event: TestEvent
    actions:
      - device: raspberry_pico
        state: "on"
  - name: TestGoogleHome
    trigger:
      event: TestEvent
    actions:
      - device: google_home
        command: "turn on the lights"
```

#### Example `modules.yaml`

```yaml
modules:
  - name: raspberry_pico
    module: src.raspberry_pico_module
    class: RaspberryPicoModule

  - name: google_home
    module: src.google_home_module
    class: GoogleHomeModule
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending the Protocol

### Adding a Device Module

1. **Create a New Module File**:
   - Add a Python file in `src/` for the new device, e.g., `src/new_device_module.py`.

2. **Inherit from `ActionModule`**:

   ```python
   from src.action_module import ActionModule

   class NewDeviceModule(ActionModule):
       def execute(self, action):
           # Implement device-specific logic here
           print(f"Executing action for NewDevice: {action}")
   ```

3. **Register the Module**:
   - Add the new module to `modules.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   - name: new_device
     module: src.new_device_module
     class: NewDeviceModule
   ```

4. **Update Intents**:
   - Define intents in `intents.yaml` to include actions for the new device.

### Integrating with On-Chain Actions

1. **Define the Blockchain Trigger**:
   - Update `intents.yaml` with a trigger for a blockchain event:

   ```yaml
   intents:
     - name: NotifyLightOnTransfer
       trigger:
         event: Transfer
         contract_address: "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"
       actions:
         - device: raspberry_pico
           state: "on"
   ```

2. **Monitor Blockchain Events**:
   - Use the dynamic ABI fetching and event listener in `intent_engine.py` to handle the event.

3. **Execute the Action**:
   - The system automatically routes the trigger to the corresponding device module.

---

## üåç Use Cases

- **IoT Automation:** Control smart devices based on token ownership or transfers.
- **Supply Chain:** Automate quality control and shipment tracking with blockchain transactions.
- **Gaming:** Trigger real-world props or rewards based on on-chain achievements.
- **Environmental Impact:** Deploy devices for monitoring and automation based on sustainability milestones.

---

## üß™ Testing the System

### Unit Tests

Run all unit tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Mock Testing with GPIO

Use the `MockFactory` in `raspberry_pico_module.py` to simulate GPIO behavior for testing on non-Raspberry Pi environments.
